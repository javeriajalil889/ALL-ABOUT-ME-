 <p>Hello there, my name is Javeria Jalil. I am currently 17 years old, a senior at New Britain High School. I was born and raised in CT, but I am originally from Pakistan. This about me page wouldn't me complete without my kitten Mano. She is very playful and curious, she's just a bundle of joy.  A few things I enjoy doing in my free time are pastel painting, watercolor painting, and sculpting. My favorite painting that I’ve created is titled “Serenity in Greenland”. I also enjoy race car driving as a female because it makes me feel confident and powerful. When it comes to cooking, I’m a big foodie so my signature dish is shrimp soft tacos with creamy avacado and jalapeno dressing.</p>

 <p>This about me page, wouldn't be certain if I didn't mention food. I  LOVE eating food, as everyone can relate to that. Here are some snapshots of the foods I enjoy. I more of a sweet tooth and favor pastries, banana pudding, macroon, boba, the list goes on. I also  gravitate more towards the savory foods lately  including authentic NY style cheese pizza, samosa's, sushi, and ramen.   </p>
